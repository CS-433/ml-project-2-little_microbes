SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION WITH VAE FOR BETTER MODEL FAIRNESS

This project aims to build a VAE model that allows to generate synthetic data to augment a dataset in order to increase a classifier's fairness. This classifier aims to predict whether a student would pass a test, based on their clicks profile on a virtual learning simulation.

The model can be run using one of four different oversampling methods, and the results of the final classifier' fairness and performance can be plotted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS:

-To change the type of oversampling before running the code:
src/configs/config.yalm 
-> Change the 'rebalancing mode' between "rebalance", "100unbalanced", "100balanced", "5050balanced"
-> Change the 'number_categories' between "2cat", "4cat"

-To run the model in the terminal (go to src file with cd command):
Without any augmentation:
$ python script_oversample.py --mode baseline

With one of the augmentation type (written in the config file):
$ python script_oversample.py --mode augmentation

-To visualize the results:
src/configs/plotter_config.yalm
-> Change the type of metrics you want to plot (de-comment them)

For metrics plotting:
python script_plotter.py --nonnested --boxplot --show

For fairness plotting:
python script_plotter.py --nonnested --show --fairness --barplot --overall

FILES:

data : contains the data file (ml4science_data_fake.pkl)(fake data for confidentiality reasons, so NOT the one that was used to train the model and plot the results)

experiments : contains the results of each run of the model

src : contains the code of the whole model
-> in src:

    -> in ml:
    
        -> in samplers:
        
            template_synthetic_oversampler : contains the code that runs to augment the data, whatever the augmentation mode
            
            final_utils : contains all the functions that template_synthetic_oversampler needs
            
            weights_files : contain the information of the best trained model that is used for the data augmentation as h5. files (using input dim = 23, batch size = 1, latent dim = 2, intermediate dim = 64, number of epochs = 120)
            
model_creation_training : contains the code that was used to create and train the VAE

best_parameters_search : contains the code that was used to plot the visualization of the latent space and find the best latent space and intermediate dimensions and number of epochs.
